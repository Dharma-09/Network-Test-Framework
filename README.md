Goals / Features

Manage an inventory of Arista devices (EOS) using pyeapi (Arista eAPI)

Provide a test runner to run scripted checks (interfaces, BGP, OSPF, config validation)

Support both unit-like tests (fast checks) and integration tests (live device queries)

Pluggable transport so you can later swap to gNMI/NETCONF/RESTCONF

CLI to run a single test, all tests, or tests for a device group

Reporting (simple JSON + stdout). CI-friendly exit codes.
